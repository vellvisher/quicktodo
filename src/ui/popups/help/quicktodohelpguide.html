<h3 class="l"><strong><u><strong><u><a name="quickadd" id="quickadd"></a></u></strong>QuickAdd</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">Adding a task is very simple. Enter the task in the command box just as  you would say it, for example- </p>
<p class="l">And that is it! This event has been added for you. The feedback pop-up informs you that the task has been added. There is no need for you to remember cumbersome entries or click on  several dropdown menus. <br />
</p>
<p class="l">QuickToDo is also highly  flexible in understanding what you intend to add.<br />
</p>
<p class="l"><strong> &ldquo;add pick up dry cleaning tmr&rdquo;</strong> <br />
</p>
<p class="l">This schedules the task for the  next day. <br />
</p>
<p class="l"><strong>&ldquo;add meeting in room2 at 2pm&rdquo;</strong> <br />
</p>
<p class="l">This automatically schedules your meeting &nbsp;at&nbsp;2pm for the same  day or the next day, if it is later than 2pm today. <br />
</p>
<p class="l">Sometimes you may wish to enter an event in its raw form.  For instance , to store dates as part of  event names, you can make sure QuickToDo does so, by entering it like this- <br />
</p>
<p class="l"><strong>&ldquo;add &ldquo;prepare 4th of july meal&rdquo; on  Friday&rdquo;</strong> <br />
</p>
<p class="l">What you enter in the quotes will be saved as it is by QuickToDo. In  this case 4th of July will be taken as part of the event name and  not the date of the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quicksort" id="quicksort"></a>QuickSort</u></strong></h3>
<p class="l">We help you categorize your schedule so that it is easier to view  and sort later.  You can therefore  group related tasks, so that it is better  organized.<br />
  QuickToDo allows you to tag each event you add with a label. So for  instance you may add an event like this: <br />
</p>
<p class="l"><strong>&ldquo;add buy milk and eggs @shopping&rdquo;</strong> <br />
</p>
<p class="l">This tags  the event under the &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; label, and thus&nbsp;groups all your shopping  tasks.<br />
  So should  you need to pull up your shopping list, you just have to type &ldquo;@shopping&rdquo; in  your command box and all items with the shopping label will be displayed.<br />
  <br />
  A task may also have multiple labels- as such:<br />
  <br />
  <strong>&ldquo;add do  assignment @homework @CS2103&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickfind" id="quickfind"></a>QuickFind</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">If you wish to find a task, there  is no need for you to type out the entire event in the format you added it. Simply  type what you can remember into the command box. This can be a part of the task  name, like this:</p>
<p class="l"><strong>&ldquo;ginger&rdquo;</strong><br />
  Or the date of the task, like  this :<br />
  <strong>&ldquo;23rd nov&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="l"><img src="dreamweaver find.PNG" width="837" height="304" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <span class="l"><br />
  As you type, QuickToDo dynamically displays the tasks which are related  to whatever you had typed into the command box. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="l">Once you spot your task, simply scroll down to it and hit enter, and the  task details will be displayed in the pane. Hence you can obtain all the  details you need about that event, after which you can&nbsp;press <strong>&ldquo;escape&rdquo;</strong> to  leave this box.<br />
</p>
<p class="l">This google-like search makes it very easy for you to retrieve your task  details without having to enter too many details or do so in any rigid format. </p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickedit" id="quickedit"></a>QuickEdit</u></strong></h3>
<span class="l"><br />
Say you want to change an event you had previously added. Simply find  the event you wish to edit( refer to QuickFind).  To edit this event, select the event and press <strong>ctrl+e</strong> and the event automatically  moves into the command box. Make the necessary changes and hit enter. Your  event has been edited accordingly!

<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickpostpone" id="quickpostpone"></a>QuickPostpone</u></strong></h3>
<p class="l"><br />
  QuickToDo offers you a quick way to reschedule your events. To postpone a  task without changing any other details, just find the event ( refer to  QuickFind) and press<strong> ctrl+p</strong>. Type in  the new time and/or date and press enter. The new time will be updated, it is that  simple!</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickdelete" id="quickdelete"></a>QuickDelete</u></strong></h3>
<p class="l"><br />
  Done with  a task? Or feel that you do not need this task anymore? You can delete an event  from your to-do manager. Find it( refer to QuickFind) and you can either  hit the <strong>delete  key</strong> or press <strong>ctrl+d.</strong> With it,  your event has been delete.  It is possible  to delete multiple events.  Select all  the events you wish to delete and likewise, hit the <strong>delete key </strong>or<strong> press ctrl+d.</strong> <br />
</p>
<p class="l">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickundo" id="quickundo"></a>QuickUndo</u></strong></h3>
<p class="l"><br />
  Accidentally deleted something? Fret not, all you have to do is type <strong>&ldquo;undo&rdquo;</strong> into the command box and all  your events can be retrieved. You can do the same for add, edit, postpone, star  and tick as well.  <br />
</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quicktick" id="quicktick"></a>QuickTick</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">Once you have completed an event, you can  choose to tick it off. To do so, select the event and press <strong>ctrl+t</strong>, which will tick the event. You  could, alternatively, <strong>click on the tick  to the right of the event. </strong><br />
</p>
<p class="l">In order  to untick your events, do the same! Select the event and press <strong>ctrl+t</strong> or <strong>click on the tick</strong> again.<br />
</p>
<p class="l">You can  mark multiple events as done by selecting all of them and ticking  simultaneously. Suppose you have completed your  shopping trip-you can simply find @shopping and press <strong>ctrl+t</strong>. You could untick multiple events in the same manner.<br />
</p>
<p class="l">To see all the events you have already ticked off, type <strong>&ldquo;done&rdquo; </strong>or <strong>&ldquo;archive&rdquo;</strong> in the command box. This will give you the list of items  you have already done. <br />
</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickstar" id="quickstar"></a>QuickStar</u></strong></h3>
<p class="l">Some tasks are more important to you than others- just star them! You  can enter a starred event like this- <br />
</p>
<p class="l"><strong>&ldquo;add *renew passport on Monday at 4pm &rdquo;</strong><br />
</p>
<p class="l">The <strong>* </strong>added before the event signifies  a starred event and the event will be entered with a star for you. You can also  star a previously added event by pressing <strong>ctrl+s</strong> <strong>or clicking on the star to the left of  the event.<br />
  </strong><br />
  If you decide that a task is no longer as important,  you can unstar a previously starred event, again using <strong>ctrl+s</strong> or <strong>clicking on that  star.</strong><br />
</p>
<p class="l">Again, you can star or unstar multiple events by selecting them and  pressing <strong>ctrl+s. </strong></p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickoverdue" id="quickoverdue"></a>QuickOverdue</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">If you have missed deadlines for some  events or simply not had the time to do them, you can see these events typing  the keyword &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; into the command box. This will show you all events that  have passed you by in the order of most importance. This helps you sort out the  task you need to give priority to.</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickreminder" id="quickreminder"></a>QuickReminder</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">To see all the events on your to-do list,  type <strong>&ldquo;reminder&rdquo;</strong> into the command  box.  QuickToDo will show you all your  events in order of importance. This is also the first pane that opens up when  you open QuickToDo, so that a list of most important things is right there in  front of you, without you having to find it.</p>

<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickcheckif" id="quickcheckif"></a>QuickCheckIf</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">QuickToDo does not just store what you tell it, it can also help you  organise! Suppose a friend asks you for lunch on Saturday at 2pm, QuickToDo can  help you check if you are free at that time. Simply type <br />
  <strong>&ldquo;checkif Saturday 2pm&rdquo;</strong><br />
  If you are not free, QuickToDo will show you what you are doing instead  and you can then shuffle your schedule if you want. <br />
</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<h3 class="l">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickcheckfree" id="quickcheckfree"></a>QuickCheckFree</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">QuickToDo  can also tell you where you can slot a task. Suppose you know a quick phone  call with your mother will take 15 minutes and you want to see where you can  fit this slot you can type-<br />
  <strong>&ldquo;Checkfree today 15 mins&rdquo; <br />
  </strong><br />
  QuickToDo gives  you options to schedule your phone call.</p>
<p class="l"></p>

<p class="l"><img src="TrialPage_clip_image009.png" alt="p10" width="457" height="53" /><br />
</p>
<p class="l">As if entry was not easy enough, we make it even easier to use.  Once you type &ldquo;a&rdquo; it will autofill to &ldquo;add&rdquo;. So entry becomes that much easier.</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quicklogin" id="quicklogin"></a>QuickLogin</u></strong><br />

</p>
  <br />

</p>
<p class="l"></p>
<h3 class="l">&nbsp;</h3>

<h3 class="l">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 class="l"><strong><u><a name="quickcall" id="quickcall"></a>QuickCall</u></strong><br />
</h3>
<p class="l">Suppose you are done using QuickToDo for  now, you can simply type <strong>&ldquo;hide&rdquo;</strong> into  the command box.</p>
<p class="l">Later, if you are, say, browing through  your mail and you want to schedule an event, all you have to do is press <strong>ctrl+shift+d</strong>, and QuickToDo pops up on  your screen, making it easy for you to add that event, with your mail in the  background. QuickToDo stays with you wherever you go on your computer. So if  you move from one application to another, QuickToDo moves with you.
